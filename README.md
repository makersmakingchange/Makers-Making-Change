Makers Making Change is an initiative of [Neil Squire](https://www.neilsquire.ca/), a Canadian non-profit that uses technology, knowledge, and passion to empower people with disabilities.

We are committed to cultivating a network of volunteer makers who support people with disabilities in their communities through cost effective assistive technology. Check out our library of free, open-source assistive technologies.
